As part of this project, we have successively:
- Developed a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not an individual is likely to suffer a heart attack.
- Created an API based on this model, and put it into production.
- Then monitor certain metrics by displaying dashboards using the Prometheus/Grafana tandem.
